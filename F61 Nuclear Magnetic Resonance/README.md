  Experimental devices: Bruker minispec p20 for parts I & II, [Bruker minispec mq7.5](https://www.bruker.com/products/mr/td-nmr/minispec-mq-series/mq75-large-seed-analyzer/overview.html) for parts III.

- Data and evaluation as below

## Preparation: NMR Signal

### § Calibration high frequency pulses

* See the high frequency pulses on the oscilloscope

  The modulation frequency of **Puls I** for 1000 pulses per second is: 

  The modulation frequency of **Puls II** for 1000 pulses per second is: 

- Define the 90° and 180° pulses

  Puls I is a 90° pulse when its time duration is set to:

  Puls II is a 180° pulse when its time duration is set to:

## Part I: Relaxation time

### § Measurements of relaxation times

#### 1. Measurement T_2 by spin echo method

- 

#### 2. Measurement T_2 by Carr-Purcell sequence

- 

#### 3. Measurement T_1

* 

### § Systematics of relaxation times for probes 1 and 3

#### 1. Measurement T_2 by spin echo method

- [Probe 1]
- [Probe 3]

#### 2. Measurement T_2 by Carr-Purcell sequence

- [Probe 1]
- [Probe 3]

#### 3. Measurement T_1

- [Probe 1]
- [Probe 3]

## Part II: Chemical shift

### § Measurement chemical shift

Associate five probes A, B, C, D and E to the substances:



## Part III: Imaging with NMR

### § One dimensional imaging in vertical direction

* 15mm oil in glass tube
* 50mm water in glass tube
* Teflon structure immersed in oil in glass tube
* 15mm sand + 4mm oil in glass tube

### § Two dimensional imaging

* 15mm oil in glass tube
