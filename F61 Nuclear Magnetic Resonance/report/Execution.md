### 3. Chemical shift

First we use probe 3 to get familiar with the measurement. We can see that the intensity is distributed in broad range because of inhomogeneity of the magnetic field.  Its width is determined by? Then we use the pressure air to put probe 3 into rotation and repeat the measurement. We observe clearly some peaks.



Then we do the measurements for probes A, B, C, D and E. Read from data on Figure 10 we can associate five probes to the substances:

| A             | B      | C       | D                 | E           |
| ------------- | ------ | ------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| fluoroacetone | toluol | p-xylol | fluoroacetonitril | acetic acid |

where we use the intensity of the measured frequency response to separate Toluol and p-xylol, which have the same chemical shifts. Since -CH_3 replaces one of the H-atom on benzene in p-xylol, we expect two peaks which has less amplitude difference, compared with two peaks of toluol.

Only the peak we measure for FCH_2-CN do not correspond to what we expect. We expect only one peak for 2 H-atoms. However, we observe 2 peaks with almost same amplitude close to each other. It can be explained by the interaction of F-atom with protons, one parallel and one antiparallel.
