## Fundamentals of NMR

### 1. Basics of NMR

#### 1.1 Magnetization

When a sample containing N protons is placed in an external magnetic field, the magnetic field induces magnetic dipole moments of nuclei. The magnetization is defined as the volume density of microscopic magnetic dipole moments. 
$$
\vec M= \frac{1}{V} \sum_i \vec{\mu_i}
$$
The magnetic dipole moment of nuclei is related to the spin $\vec J$:
$$
\vec \mu = \hbar \gamma \vec J
$$
where $\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio of the nucleus. For protons $\gamma = 2.6752 \cdot 10^8 sec^{-1}Tesla^{-1}$.

In the ground state, where energy is minimized, $N_+$ protons in the sample have magnetic dipole moment parallel to the magnetic field, $N_-$ antiparallel, where ​$N=N_+ + N_-$. The occupation number ​$N_+$ and $N_-$ follow Dirac statistics, but can here be approximated by a Boltzmann distribution:
$$
N_{\pm}=N_0 e^{-\frac{E_0 + \Delta E}{kT}}
$$
where $N_0​$ is a normalization factor. The parallel state is energetically favourable, hence $N_+ > N_-​$. 

Thus we have: 
$$
\vec M = \frac{1}{V}(N_+ -N_-)|\vec \mu| \vec{e_z}=\frac{\mu N}{V} \sinh(\frac{\mu B}{kT}) \vec{e_z}
$$
If the magnetic field is weak($\mu B << kT​$), the $$\sinh​$$ function can be expanded and the Curie's law follows:
$$
\vec M = \frac{N}{V} \frac{\hbar ^2 \gamma^2 I(I+1)}{3kT} \vec{B_0} \sim \frac{\vec{B_0}}{T}
$$
In general, the magnetization can have an arbitrary direction relative to the external field. It can be generated by applying a high frequency pulse $\omega_{HF}$ to the ground state. In the following we decompose it into components $M_{\parallel}$ (anti-)parallel and $M_{\perp}$ perpendicular to the external field. 

The magnetic dipole interacts with an external magnetic field $\vec B_0​$ follows:
$$
\Delta E = - \vec \mu \cdot \vec B_0
$$
Thus the general state of magnetization would dissipate its excitation energy and reach the ground state asymptotically on a characteristic time scale.

The interaction results in a torque:
$$
\vec \tau = \vec M \times \vec B_0
$$
The torque acts therefore only on $M_{\perp}$.  Without relaxation processes, the rate of change of $M_{\perp}$ is given by:
$$
\frac{d\vec M_\perp}{dt}=-\gamma M_\perp \times \vec B_0
$$

Hence $\vec M_{\perp}​$ precesses around $\vec B_0​$ with Larmor frequency $\omega_L = \gamma B_0 ​$ by inserting an ansatz $\vec M=(M_{\perp} \cos{\omega_L t}, M_{\perp} \sin{\omega_L t})​$. 

#### 1.2 Generation of general magnetisation

Consider the ground state magnetization $\vec M$ parallel to $\vec B_0$, pointing in z-direction. A sinusoidal voltage of frequency $\omega_{HF}$ is applied on the along x-direction oriented coil, resulting in an induced magnetic field $ B_1$, which is longitudinally polarized along x-direction. Then $\vec M$ precesses around the x-axis. During a time interval $\Delta t$ the angle $\alpha$ of precession is then:
$$
\alpha = \gamma B_1 \Delta t
$$
If the time interval is chosen such that $\alpha = 90°$ , then $\vec M$ is rotated into a perpendicular component $M_{\perp}$ along the y-axis. Such a pulse is called a 90° pulse. Similarly, we define 180° pulse which results in magnetization antiparallel to the static field $\vec B_0$.

### 2. Relaxation time

#### 2.1 Bloch equations

The relaxation process of magnetization is described by Bloch equations. Here we introduce the rotating frame of the transverse magnetization, where the transverse magnetization is constant if no relaxation processes take place. The Bloch equations assume that the time evolution is dominated by a restoring force which is proportional to the deflection from equilibrium.
$$
\frac{dM_{\perp}(t)}{dt}=-\frac{M_{\perp}(t)}{T_2}
$$

$$
\frac{dM_{\parallel}(t)}{dt}=-\frac{M_{\parallel}(t)-M_0}{T_1}
$$

where $T_2$ is the spin-spin relaxation time, $T_1$ the spin-lattice relaxation time. $M_0$ denotes the ground state magnetization.

The solutions are:
$$
M_{\perp}(t)=M_{\perp}^0 e^{-\frac{t}{T_2}}
$$

$$
M_{\parallel}(t)=M_0(1-2e^{-t/T_1})
$$

In laboratory system we have $\frac{d\vec M}{dt}=\frac{\partial \vec M^{rot}}{\partial t}+\vec \omega \times \vec M$, which leads to:
$$
\frac{d\vec M_{\perp}(t)}{dt}=-\frac{M_{\perp}(t)}{T_2} +\gamma (\vec B \times \vec M)_{\perp}
$$

$$
\frac{d\vec M_{\parallel}(t)}{dt}=-\frac{M_{\parallel}(t)-M_0}{T_1} +\gamma (\vec B \times \vec M)_{\parallel}
$$

#### 2.2 Spin-spin relaxation $T_2$ by spin echo method

The excitation energy of excited states is contributed by spin-lattice contribution and spin-spin contribution. The former indicates the interaction of the magnetic dipoles with the external magnetic field (eq. 6). The latter indicates the interaction of two magnetic dipoles depends on the orientation of the dipoles. The antiparallel orientation is energetically favourable. A transverse magnetization hence contains the corresponding interaction energy when many magnetic dipoles are oriented parallel to each other.

As illustrated in the following figure, consider a 90° pulse at time $t=0$. The pulse generates a transverse magnetization $M_{\perp}$ along the y-axis, which precess around the static field $\vec B_0$ with a Larmor frequency $\omega_L$. Protons at different locations will have slightly different $\omega_L$ due to the inhomogeneity of the field. For example, protons at location A precess clockwise with larger frequency $\omega_A> \omega_B$ than protons at location B due to larger magnetic field at A. At time $t=\tau$ they acquire a phase difference, i.e. protons at A are ahead of protons at B. At time $t=\tau$ a 180° pulse is applied, where $\tau$ is much shorter than the relaxation time $T_2$.   The magnetic dipoles are then rotated by 180° around the x-axis. The dipole orientation of the protons at locations A and B is reversed, i.e. protons at B are ahead of protons at A. The time duration of 180° pulse is short as compared to $\tau$ and hence can be neglected. With further precession the protons at A and B are in phase again after another time interval $\tau$. All the magnetic dipoles in phase build up the magnetization $M_{\perp}$ at time $t=2\tau$.

An example signal shows as follows with $\tau=10​$ ms. Decrease at $t<5​$ s is the decay of the transverse magnetization due to loss of coherence as explained above. Then the spin echo builds up after applying 180° pulse and reaches its maximum at time $t=2\tau​$. Measuring maxima for different $\tau​$ and using eq.(12) one can get the decay curve.

The spin echo method has limitations when measuring the decay curve at large $\tau$. The protons can move to different locations due to molecular diffusion before the 180° pulse is applied. The average Larmor frequencies in the time intervals $0<t<\tau$ and $\tau<t<2\tau$ can hence be different due to field inhomogeneities. In that case only partial coherence is achieved at $t=2\tau$, which means reduced signals with a correspondingly reduced value for $T_2$. 

#### 2.3 Spin-spin relaxation $T_2$ by Carr-Purcell sequence

To minimize the effects of molecular diffusion and field inhomogeneities the Carr-Purcell sequence is used. For $t\leq2\tau$ the protons experience the same procedure as in spin echo method. The system then starts to loose the coherence again due to field inhomogeneities. At time $t=3\tau$ another 180° pulse is applied, hence the system is phase coherent at $t=4\tau$. This pattern repeats when one always applies 180° pulses at odd multiples time of $\tau$. The measurement of $T_2​$ in that case is closer to the true value as compared to spin echo method.

#### 2.4 Spin-lattice relaxation $T_1$

The spin lattice measurement starts with a 180° pulse. The produced magnetization is antiparallel to the external $\vec B_0$ field, which does not produce a signal. At $t=\tau$ the 90° pulse is applied,$M_{\parallel}$ is then transformed to a transverse magnetization, which will induce a signal in the coil. The signal is proportional to $M_{\parallel}$ at $t=\tau$.  Measuring maxima for different $\tau​$ and using eq.(13) one can get the decay curve.

### 3. Chemical shift

The Larmor frequency is magnetic field dependent, which can varies from molecule to molecule due to a contribution of the electron orbitals $\delta \vec B​$. The additional magnetic field is proportional to external magnetic field:
$$
\delta \vec B = -\sigma \vec B_0
$$
where $\sigma$ characterises the magnetic shielding of the external field $\vec B_0$. Thus with the total magnetic field $\vec B = \vec B_0 + \delta \vec B$ the shielding factor can be determined if the modified Larmor frequency $\omega_i$ is measured:
$$
\omega_i = \omega_L (1-\sigma_i)
$$
where $\omega_L$ is the free Larmor frequency. 

Chemical shift is defined as the difference of the shielding factor between subject substance and a reference substance, which in our case is Tetra-Methyl-Silan (TMS). It has units ppm(part per million):
$$
\delta_i = \sigma_i -\sigma_{TMS} = \frac{\omega_L-\omega_i}{\omega_L}-\frac{\omega_L - \omega_{TMS}}{\omega_L}=\frac{\omega_{TMS} - \omega_{i}}{\omega_L}
$$
For our experimental purpose the chemical shifts of some organic compounds relative to TMS is given as below:
