## Fundamentals of NMR

### 1. Basics of NMR

#### 1.1 Magnetization

When a sample containing N protons is placed in an external magnetic field, the magnetic field induces magnetic dipole moments of nuclei. The magnetization is defined as the volume density of microscopic magnetic dipole moments. 
$$
\vec M= \frac{1}{V} \sum_i \vec{\mu_i}
$$
The magnetic dipole moment of nuclei is related to the spin $\vec J​$:
$$
\vec \mu = \hbar \gamma \vec J
$$
where $\gamma​$ is the gyromagnetic ratio of the nucleus. For protons $\gamma = 2.6752 \cdot 10^8 sec^{-1}Tesla^{-1}​$.

In the ground state, where energy is minimized, $N_+​$ protons in the sample have magnetic dipole moment parallel to the magnetic field, $N_-​$ antiparallel, where ​$N=N_+ + N_-​$. The occupation number ​$N_+​$ and $N_-​$ follow Dirac statistics, but can here be approximated by a Boltzmann distribution:
$$
N_{\pm}=N_0 e^{-\frac{E_0 + \Delta E}{kT}}
$$
where $N_0​$ is a normalization factor. The parallel state is energetically favourable, hence $N_+ > N_-​$. 

Thus we have: 
$$
\vec M = \frac{1}{V}(N_+ -N_-)|\vec \mu| \vec{e_z}=\frac{\mu N}{V} \sinh(\frac{\mu B}{kT}) \vec{e_z}
$$
If the magnetic field is weak($\mu B << kT​$), the $$\sinh​$$ function can be expanded and the Curie's law follows:
$$
\vec M = \frac{N}{V} \frac{\hbar ^2 \gamma^2 I(I+1)}{3kT} \vec{B_0} \sim \frac{\vec{B_0}}{T}
$$
In general, the magnetization can have an arbitrary direction relative to the external field. It can be generated by applying a high frequency pulse $\omega_{HF}$ to the ground state. In the following we decompose it into components $M_{\parallel}$ (anti-)parallel and $M_{\perp}$$ perpendicular to the external field. 

The magnetic dipole interacts with an external magnetic field $\vec B_0​$ follows:
$$
\Delta E = - \vec \mu \cdot \vec B_0
$$
Thus the general state of magnetization would dissipate its excitation energy and reach the ground state asymptotically on a characteristic time scale.

The interaction results in a torque:
$$
\vec \tau = \vec M \times \vec B_0
$$
The torque acts therefore only on $M_{\perp}$.  Without relaxation processes, the rate of change of $M_{\perp}$ is given by:
$$
\frac{d\vec M_\perp}{dt}=-\gamma M_\perp \times \vec B_0
$$

Hence $\vec M_{\perp}​$ precesses around $\vec B_0​$ with Larmor frequency $\omega_L = \gamma B_0 ​$ by inserting an ansatz $\vec M=(M_{\perp} \cos{\omega_L t}, M_{\perp} \sin{\omega_L t})​$. 

#### 1.2 Generation of general magnetisation

Consider the ground state magnetization $\vec M$ parallel to $\vec B_0$, pointing in z-direction. A sinusoidal voltage of frequency $\omega_{HF}$ is applied on the along x-direction oriented coil, resulting in an induced magnetic field $ B_1$, which is longitudinally polarized along x-direction. Then $\vec M$ precesses around the x-axis. During a time interval $\Delta t$ the angle $\alpha​$ of precession is then:
$$
\alpha = \gamma B_1 \Delta t
$$
If the time interval is chosen such that $\alpha = 90°$ , then $\vec M$ is rotated into a perpendicular component $M_{\perp}$ along the y-axis. Such a pulse is called a 90° pulse. Similarly, we define 180° pulse which results in magnetization antiparallel to the static field $\vec B_0$.
