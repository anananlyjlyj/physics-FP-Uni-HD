## Layout of the experiment

The experiment is performed with Bruker minispec p20 in parts I and II, Bruker minispec mq7.5 in part III.  

The electronic unit of Bruker minispec p20 can generate 2 pulses, namely Puls I, which should be set to 90° pulse, and Puls II for 180° pulse. Output signal can be set to be single or periodic with variable periodicity. 4 Buttons allow us to produce pulse sequence Puls I - Puls I, Puls II - Puls I, Puls I - Puls II, and Carr-Purcell sequence(Puls I - Puls II - Puls II - Puls II - ...).  

The magnetic unit is connected to the p20 electronics by a cable, which transmits the high frequency pulses $\omega_{HF}$ generated by the electronics to the coil inside the magnet and, at the same time, transmits the signal induced in the coil back to the electronics. The coil signal $\omega_{L}$ is then mixed with the signal $\omega_{HF}$. The mixing generate two signals, one with a frequency of the sum and one with the frequency of the difference, i.e. the working frequency (on the order of a few hundred Hertz). One use the working frequency for analysis. Note that $\omega_{HF}$ is fixed, whereas $\omega_{L}$ can be changed by turning the screw of the magnet.

The Bruker minispec mq7.5 is equipped with a permanent magnetic field of 0.17 T and a measurement frequency of 7.5 MHz. Signals are generated by the sensitive nuclei(hydrogen and fluorine) because of NMR and are detected by the minispec.

The experiment execution, data acquisition and analysis of all 3 parts of this experiment was performed on two local computers in laboratory. The software we used was LabVIEW, a systems engineering software for applications that require test, measurement, and control  hardware and access to data.
