## Abstract(TODO)

This experiment has been performed as part of the advanced lab course for physics students (FP) at Heidelberg University. 

The theoretical and experimental basics needed for the understanding of the conducted measurements is introduced and important concepts of nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) are presented and discussed. 

The characteristics of a NMR machine are analysed using data we recorded with the Bruker minispec p20 and the  computer program LabView in the laboratory. 

Furthermore we used Bruker minispec mq7.5 for getting 1d- and 2d-images of different subjects. 

Lastly we present and discuss some applications of NMR in modern society.
