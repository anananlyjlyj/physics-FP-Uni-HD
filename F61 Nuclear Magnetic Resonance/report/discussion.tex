\section{Discussion}
The fits from the .vi program gave us errors of  fit parameters $T_2$  of around 2\%, but the difference between relaxation time measured by spin-echo and by Carr-Purcell method is around 7\% . In that sense we can see that molecular diffusion and inhomogeneities of magnetic field are major sources of systematic errors. And since it's still hard to estimate their effects in Carr-Purcell method. Also it should be considered that some of the measurements had very few data points which leads to the question how powerful such a fit error would be.

For p-xylol and toluol, in the chemical shift determination, we expected the same peak positions with different amplitude, since they have similar NMR-active components. But as seen in \ref{table2}, toluol's peak  experience a relative large shift compared to the other substances. For example the peak for CH$_3$ for p-xylol and acetic acid appear both around 2.0 but at 2.6 for toluol. Same could also be observed for  the 3rd peaks, the benzol.

Unlike other spectroscopic techniques, NMR is unaffected by sample color and surface properties. Hence it is perfectly suited for many fields, e.g. food industry, healthcare industry etc., because it is a non destructive and non-invasive measurement that requires no sample preparation \cite{bruker}.\\
Although in this experiment we use NMR to differentiate several substances, in reality it is in some cases not practical. Since, as shown in figure \ref{shi1}, particular peaks can mean several parts and as long as one doesn't already have a general idea about the substance, it can be near impossible to find out what substance one are dealing with alone off the those resonances.

Some actual modern applications of NMR are for example the Spectroscopy of $^{31}$P which is a essential Part of the living cell and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) which is widely used for medical purposes in modern day and age.\\
